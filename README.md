# 🛡️ SSH Honeypot Project (Cybersecurity Internship)

## 📌 Objective
To build a custom SSH honeypot in Kali Linux that simulates a vulnerable SSH service and captures unauthorized connection attempts.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Python 3
- Nmap (for attack simulation)

## ⚙️ Implementation

A custom Python-based SSH honeypot was developed that:
- Listens on port 2222
- Logs attacker IP addresses
- Records timestamps
- Stores transmitted data
- Saves logs in CSV format

## 🧪 Attack Simulation

## 📊 Output

Captured:
- Attacker IP
- Timestamp
- Source port
- Transmitted payload

## 🎓 Skills Learned

- Network socket programming
- Threat intelligence logging
- Attack simulation
- Log analysis
- Cybersecurity monitoring

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Multi-port honeypot
- Web dashboard
- Real-time alerts
- Geo-IP tracking
